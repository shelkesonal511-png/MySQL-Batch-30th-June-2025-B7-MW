-- Functions 

/*

Functions in MySQL are predefined operations that can be used to perform calculations, manipulate data, 
and retrieve specific information. These functions make it easier to work with strings, numbers, dates, and more. 
Functions--- 1. Built-in functions (sum(),avg(),count()...)    
             2. User defined functions.

They are categorized as follows based on their functionality: 

1. String Functions
These functions are used to manipulate and process string data.

LENGTH(str): Returns the length of a string.

CONCAT(str1, str2, ...): Concatenates two or more strings.

UPPER(str): Converts a string to uppercase.

LOWER(str): Converts a string to lowercase.

SUBSTRING(str, start, length): Returns a substring from a string.


2. Numeric Functions
These functions perform operations on numeric data.

ROUND(number, decimals): Rounds a number to a specified number of decimal places.

FLOOR(number): Returns the largest integer less than or equal to a number.

CEIL(number): Returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to a number.

ABS(number): Returns the absolute value of a number.


3. Date and Time Functions
These functions are used to manipulate and format date and time values.

NOW(): Returns the current date and time.

CURDATE(): Returns the current date.

DATE_FORMAT(date, format): Formats a date according to a specified format.

DATEDIFF(date1, date2): Returns the difference in days between two dates.


4. Aggregate Functions
These functions perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value.

COUNT(expression): Returns the number of rows that match a specified condition.

SUM(column): Returns the sum of a numeric column.

AVG(column): Returns the average value of a numeric column.

MAX(column): Returns the maximum value of a column.

MIN(column): Returns the minimum value of a column.


5. Control Flow Functions
These functions allow for conditional logic in SQL queries.

IF(condition, true_value, false_value): Returns one value if the condition is true and another value 
if it is false.

CASE: Provides a way to perform conditional logic in a more complex manner.


6. Conversion Functions
These functions convert data from one type to another.

CAST(expression AS type): Converts an expression to a specified data type.

CONVERT(expression, type): Similar to CAST, but with different syntax.


7. JSON Functions
These functions are used to work with JSON data types.

JSON_EXTRACT(json_doc, path): Extracts data from a JSON document.

JSON_ARRAYAGG(value): Aggregates values into a JSON array.



8. User -Defined Functions (UDFs)
MySQL allows users to create their own functions for specific tasks.
