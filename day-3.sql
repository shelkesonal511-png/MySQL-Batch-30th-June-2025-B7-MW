-- Data types

/*

The data type of a column in a MySQL database tells us what kind of values that column can hold, 
such as:
-- Integer (whole numbers)
-- Character (text)
-- Date and Time (dates and times)
-- Binary (raw data)
-- Enum (a list of allowed values)
-- Set (a list of allowed values)
-- Time (time of day)
-- Timestamp (date and time)
-- Year (year)
-- Float (decimal values)
-- Double (decimal values)
-- Decimal (decimal values)

Every column in a database table must have a name and a data type.
When creating a table, an SQL developer needs to choose the right data type for each column. 
This helps MySQL know what kind of data to expect and how to work with it.

Datatypes defines the type & size of data to be stored in an attribute. as- id int (1,2,3,...)
In MySQL, there are three main categories of data types:

String: For text values (e.g., names, descriptions).
Numeric: For numbers (e.g., ages, prices).
Date and Time: For dates and times (e.g., birthdays, timestamps).

Note- Choosing the correct data type is important for ensuring data accuracy and efficient storage.

*/

-- Constraints 
/*
In MySQL, constraints are rules applied to columns in a database table to enforce data integrity and 
ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data stored in the database. Constraints help maintain the 
quality of the data by restricting the types of data that can be entered into a table and by defining 
relationships between tables.


Types of Constraints in MySQL

1. NOT NULL

Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value.

Example:

CREATE TABLE Students (
    ID INT NOT NULL,
    Name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);

2.UNIQUE

Ensures that all values in a column are unique.
Example:

CREATE TABLE Employees (
    Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
);

3. PRIMARY KEY

Uniquely identifies each record in a table.
Combines NOT NULL and UNIQUE constraints.

Example:

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ProductName VARCHAR(50)
);

4. FOREIGN KEY

Ensures referential integrity between two tables.
A column in one table refers to the primary key of another table.

Example:

CREATE TABLE Customers (
    CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY
);

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CustomerID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID)
);

5. CHECK

Ensures that all values in a column satisfy a specific condition.

Example:

CREATE TABLE Products (
    ProductID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Price DECIMAL(10, 2) CHECK (Price > 0)
);

6. DEFAULT

Assigns a default value to a column if no value is specified.

Example:

CREATE TABLE Users (
    UserID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'Active'
);

7. AUTO_INCREMENT

Automatically generates a unique value for a column whenever a new record is inserted.

Example:

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    ProductName VARCHAR(50)
);

8. INDEX

Improves the performance of queries by creating an index on specified columns.
While not a direct constraint, it enforces rules like uniqueness when combined with UNIQUE.

Example:

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_email ON Employees(Email);

Benefits of Using Constraints

Data Integrity: Ensures valid and consistent data.
Error Prevention: Avoids accidental insertion of invalid or duplicate data.
Relational Consistency: Maintains proper relationships between tables.
Constraints are essential tools for maintaining a well-structured and reliable database system.

 /*
 In MySQL, commands are instructions that you use to interact with the database. 
 They allow you to perform various operations such as creating databases and tables, 
 inserting and updating data, querying data, and managing user permissions. 
 MySQL commands can be categorized into several types based on their functionality:

DDL(Data Definition Language): Defines database structures (CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE).
DML(Data Manipulation Language): Manipulates data (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
DQL(Data Query Language): Queries data (SELECT).
DCL(Data Control Language): Controls access (GRANT, REVOKE).
TCL(Transaction Control Language): Manages transactions (COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT).

*/


/*
Clauses are components of a SQL statement that specify the actions to be performed on 
the data in a database. Each clause serves a specific purpose and helps to define the 
structure and behavior of the SQL query. Clauses can be combined to create complex 
queries that retrieve, manipulate, or manage data.

the main clauses in MySQL include:
SELECT: Retrieves data from a database table.
FROM: Specifies the table(s) to retrieve data from.
WHERE: Filters data based on conditions.
GROUP BY: Groups data based on one or more columns.
HAVING: Filters grouped data based on conditions.
ORDER BY: Sorts data in ascending or descending order.
LIMIT: Limits the number of rows returned.

*/

/*
Clauses Vs Cammands --

Commands: 
These are the main instructions you use to interact with the database 
(e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, etc.). They perform specific actions on the database.

Clauses: 
These are parts of SQL statements that provide additional details or conditions to the commands 
(e.g., WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, etc.). They help refine the command's operation.

Select * from students where name = 'Kavya';

In essence, commands are the actions you want to perform, while clauses are the conditions 
or modifications that help define how those actions should be executed. Understanding both is crucial 
for effective database management and querying.
 
*/

 
/*
SELECT Query : 

The SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from a database table. 
It allows you to specify the columns you want to fetch and apply conditions to filter the results.

Syntax-

SELECT column1, column2, ...  
FROM table_name  
WHERE condition;
